# Note Taker

In this assignment I was tasked with creating an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use and Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. This application has been deployed to Heroku.

## User Story

- _AS A small business owner_
- _I WANT to be able to write and save notes_
- _SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete_

## Acceptance Criteria

- _GIVEN a note-taking application_
- _WHEN I open the Note Taker_
- _THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page_
- _WHEN I click on the link to the notes page_
- _THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to    enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column_
- _WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text_
- _THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page_
- _WHEN I click on the Save icon_
- _THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes_
- _WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column_
- _THEN that note appears in the right-hand column_
- _WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page_
- _THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column_
